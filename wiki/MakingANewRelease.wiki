= Introduction =

This page, intended for developers, outlines the process we follow in making a new release of JIDT:

 # Check the PDFs for all Demos in the repository are up to date
 # Update build.xml for the new version number
 # Update readme.txt with release notes etc
 # Build the releases in a clean svn download
 # Check sha1 of the new release: `sha1sum infodynamics-dist-1.0.zip`
 # Post the code to lizier.me, make new counter files, ready and chmod them via ssh access. (Can also chmod via a web ftp on siteground; but by copying old counter files they tend to have the right permissions already)
 # Post the Javadocs to lizier.me and link from our [Documentation] page
 # Link to the new code on the [Downloads] page, [Installation] page and the front page of the google code site
 # Update the news on the front page about the release and with release notes
 # Mail the mailing list
 # Tweet about the new release
 # Update jar to clojars
