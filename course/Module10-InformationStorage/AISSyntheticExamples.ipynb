    "4. How much information storage did you predict for this example? Did this match the output from the code above? Do you need to change the history length $k$ parameter to be longer than the default of 1 to see the result you expect? You can use the AutoAnalyser to see the line of code to use to change the $k$ parameter to something other than its default value. Modify your code so that you can set any value for the k parameter:\n",
