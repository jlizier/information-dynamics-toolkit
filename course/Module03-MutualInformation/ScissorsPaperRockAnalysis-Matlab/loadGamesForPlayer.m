% function games = loadGamesForPlayer(name)
%
% Returns a cell array of game sets for the given player name.
% For each game set, first column is the player's move, second is their
% opponents, and third column is whether they won (1), lost (-1) or drew (0)
% 
% Inputs:
% - name - player name, as a string. Can be '*' to get games for all players
% Outputs:
% - games - cell array of all games played by this player. Each cell, games{i},
%   holds data for a separate game. Each game{i} is a 2D array where each row
%   represents a single iterations within the game. The first column are
%   the player's moves (0 == scissors, 1 == paper, 2 == rock), the second
%   colummn are the opponents moves, and the third column is the result
%   (1 == this player won, 0 == tie, -1 == opponent won).
% If no output argument is requested, the results are simply printed to the
%  standard output.
